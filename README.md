# PulseHub

PulseHub is a Google Apps Script web application designed to serve as a central hub for employee resources.

The project consists of a simple script (`Code.gs`) and a corresponding `index.html` file served via `HtmlService`. The header displays the company logo along with real-time date, time, and weather information.

To deploy, create a new Apps Script project, copy the files from the repository root, and publish as a web app.
